This folder contains the R code I'd created while taking part in Analytics Vidhya's Click Data Conversion Payout Hackathon.

The train and test file sizes were too large for me to do this analysis on my local machine. I created a google cloud VM instance and performed my project on that VM. All the commands written down in the script file were performed in REPL fashion on the created VM's terminal.

More details about the hackathon can be found here : https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/click-prediction/

For details on how to levereage the use of Google cloud I've uploaded a manual I found on the interent containing the steps to be followed.
